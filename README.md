# FlamingDiaper
Repo for some homegrown vector/hi-res artwork of NCSSM's famous Flaming Diaper Logo. I graduated in 2005 and fondly remember the logo, even though it was a bit before my time.  I suspect there are a fair number of alumni who could use a higher res or vector version so this is it.

I wish I had the email from Joe Liles that fully explained the original source of this logo for the school (long since lost in the waste bin of history). IIRC, the story was that it was made in an art design class at NCSU after a grouping of students were told to create logos for this weird new residential high school for smarty pants students was being built in North Carolina.

If you know the full details then let me know and I'll update this. You can contact me at marshall@team900.org or massengill05m@ncssm.edu.

Also, if you are an alum then do your part and donate to the NCSSM Foundation, please.
